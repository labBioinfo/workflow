# workflow
Workflow for our project. The objective is to run the various analysis scripts automatically, and, ideally, quickly (but let's not get ahead of ourselves).

Each folder is for a specific part of the project, which will then be synchronized/automated/what have you later.

The workflow has been updated to include a very basic menu (which will get updated, I swear!), and integrates some of the Database scripts (namely the ones for creating the folders and assembling the Greengenes kraken database. They seem to be working, although I couldn't fully test Greengenes, as it requires an ftp connection (which I was sadly lacking in when made the script).

In any case, I plan to integrate the rest of the Database scripts once I have the ones I need (check the Issues!).
